Python_3
=========
1-- Write a Python program to append a list to the second list.

2-- 
Write a Python program to get the 4th element and 4th element from last of a tuple.

3-- 
Write a Python program to check whether an element exists within a tuple.


4-- Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5,
 between two given numbers (both included)
5-- 

Write a Python program to compute the distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).


6-- Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead.
If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.


7-- Write a Python program to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string.


8-- Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to n.
    For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print
    "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".


9-- Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters.
Use a separate condition for each validity rule

10-- Write a Python program to check the validity of a given password.
    Validation :

        At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
        At least 1 number between [0-9].
        At least 1 character from [$#@].
        Minimum length 6 characters.
        Maximum length 16 characters.


11-- Write a Python program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a given number.


12-- Write a Python program to calculate the sum and average of n integer numbers


13-- Write a Python program to print the following pattern
